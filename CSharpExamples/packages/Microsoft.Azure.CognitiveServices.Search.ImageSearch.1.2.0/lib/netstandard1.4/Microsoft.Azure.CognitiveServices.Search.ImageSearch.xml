            The Image Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get
            back a list of relevant images. This section provides technical
            details about the query parameters and headers that you use to
            request images and the JSON response objects that contain them. For
            examples that show how to make requests, see [Searching the Web for
            Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/search-the-web).
            </summary>
            <param name='query'>
            The user's search query term. The term cannot be empty. The term
            may contain [Bing Advanced
            Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795620.aspx). For
            example, to limit images to a specific domain, use the
            [site:](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) operator.
            To help improve relevance of an insights query (see
            [insightsToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#insightstoken)),
            you should always include the user's query term. Use this parameter
            only with the Image Search API.Do not specify this parameter when
            calling the Trending Images API.

            set this header, you must also specify the
            [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
            query parameter. To determine the market to return results for,
            Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the list and
            combines it with the cc parameter value. If the list does not
            include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and
            market that supports the request or it uses an aggregated or
            default market for the results. To determine the market that Bing
            used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
            query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise,
            use the
            [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)

            as a label in a user interface. There are few user interface
            strings in the JSON response objects. Any links to Bing.com
            properties in the response objects apply the specified language.

            The user agent originating the request. Bing uses the user agent to
            provide mobile users with an optimized experience. Although
            optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header. The
            user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used browser
            sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
            2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The

            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior
            across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features and
            improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
            traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID
            for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user
            to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple
            conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight
            assignment than the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also,
            Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that client
            ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user.
            Bing also uses this header to help improve result rankings by
            analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance
            improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing
            APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this
            header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests
            for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API
            consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
            click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing
            APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have
            a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not include this
            header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should
            NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user
            uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API
            request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist
            the client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent
            HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not
            use a session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the
            device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the
            user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If
            the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it
            for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If
            you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in
            the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is
            used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the location
            information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional,
            you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
            X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for
            example, by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address
            results in the location not being anywhere near the device's actual
            location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the
            client's geographical location. Bing uses the location information
            to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local
            content. Specify the key/value pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;.
            The following are the keys that you use to specify the user's
            location. lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in
            degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and
            less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long
            (required): The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
            longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or
            equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
            positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
            radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the
            coordinates. Pass the value returned by the device's location
            service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell
            tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
            location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since
            January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or
            direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees
            from 0 through 360, counting clockwise relative to true north.
            Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The
            horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client
            device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that
            specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this
            key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
            optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate
            the location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the
            location is especially important if the client's IP address does
            not accurately reflect the user's physical location (for example,
            if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include
            this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you
            should include this header.
            </param>
            <param name='aspect'>
            Filter images by the following aspect ratios. All: Do not filter by
            aspect.Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the
            aspect parameter. Square: Return images with standard aspect ratio.
            Wide: Return images with wide screen aspect ratio. Tall: Return
            images with tall aspect ratio. Possible values include: 'All',

            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
            If you set this parameter, you must also specify the
            [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
            header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the
            languages list, and combine that language with the country code
            that you specify to determine the market to return results for. If
            the languages list does not include a supported language, Bing
            finds the closest language and market that supports the request, or
            it may use an aggregated or default market for the results instead
            of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
            Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple
            languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query
            parameters. This parameter and the
            [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
            query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
            </param>
            <param name='count'>
            The number of images to return in the response. The actual number
            delivered may be less than requested. The default is 35. The
            maximum value is 150. You use this parameter along with the offset
            parameter to page results.For example, if your user interface
            displays 20 images per page, set count to 20 and offset to 0 to get
            the first page of results.For each subsequent page, increment
            offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). Use this parameter only with
            the Image Search API.Do not specify this parameter when calling the
            Insights, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.

            images discovered by Bing within the last 30 days. Possible values
            include: 'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
            </param>
            <param name='height'>
            Filter images that have the specified height, in pixels. You may
            use this filter with the size filter to return small images that
            have a height of 150 pixels.
            </param>
            <param name='id'>
            An ID that uniquely identifies an image. Use this parameter to
            ensure that the specified image is the first image in the list of
            images that Bing returns. The
            [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
            object's imageId field contains the ID that you set this parameter

            images. ShareCommercially: Return images that may be shared with
            others for personal or commercial purposes. Changing or editing the
            image might not be allowed. Modify: Return images that may be
            modified, shared, and used. Changing or editing the image might not
            be allowed. Modifying, sharing, and using the image for commercial
            purposes might not be allowed. ModifyCommercially: Return images
            that may be modified, shared, and used for personal or commercial
            purposes. Typically, this option returns the fewest images. For
            more information about these license types, see [Filter Images By
            License Type](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=309768).

            </param>
            <param name='market'>
            The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the
            country where the user is making the request from. However, it
            could be a different country if the user is not located in a
            country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
            &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country code&gt;. For example, en-US. The
            string is case insensitive. For a list of possible market values,
            see [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
            NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market.
            Specifying the market helps Bing route the request and return an
            appropriate and optimal response. If you specify a market that is
            not listed in [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
            Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that
            is subject to change. This parameter and the

            <param name='maxFileSize'>
            Filter images that are less than or equal to the specified file
            size. The maximum file size that you may specify is 520,192 bytes.
            If you specify a larger value, the API uses 520,192. It is possible
            that the response may include images that are slightly larger than
            the specified maximum. You may specify this filter and minFileSize
            to filter images within a range of file sizes.
            </param>
            <param name='maxHeight'>
            Filter images that have a height that is less than or equal to the
            specified height. Specify the height in pixels. You may specify
            this filter and minHeight to filter images within a range of
            heights. This filter and the height filter are mutually exclusive.
            </param>
            <param name='maxWidth'>
            Filter images that have a width that is less than or equal to the
            specified width. Specify the width in pixels. You may specify this
            filter and maxWidth to filter images within a range of widths. This
            filter and the width filter are mutually exclusive.
            </param>
            <param name='minFileSize'>
            Filter images that are greater than or equal to the specified file
            size. The maximum file size that you may specify is 520,192 bytes.
            If you specify a larger value, the API uses 520,192. It is possible
            that the response may include images that are slightly smaller than
            the specified minimum. You may specify this filter and maxFileSize
            to filter images within a range of file sizes.
            </param>
            <param name='minHeight'>
            Filter images that have a height that is greater than or equal to
            the specified height. Specify the height in pixels. You may specify
            this filter and maxHeight to filter images within a range of
            heights. This filter and the height filter are mutually exclusive.
            </param>
            <param name='minWidth'>
            Filter images that have a width that is greater than or equal to
            the specified width. Specify the width in pixels. You may specify
            this filter and maxWidth to filter images within a range of widths.
            This filter and the width filter are mutually exclusive.
            </param>
            <param name='offset'>
            The zero-based offset that indicates the number of images to skip
            before returning images. The default is 0. The offset should be
            less than
            ([totalEstimatedMatches](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#totalestimatedmatches)
            - count). Use this parameter along with the count parameter to page
            results. For example, if your user interface displays 20 images per
            page, set count to 20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of
            results. For each subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for
            example, 0, 20, 40). It is possible for multiple pages to include
            some overlap in results. To prevent duplicates, see
            [nextOffset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#nextoffset).
            Use this parameter only with the Image API. Do not specify this
            parameter when calling the Trending Images API or the Web Search
            API.
            </param>
            <param name='safeSearch'>
            Filter images for adult content. The following are the possible
            filter values. Off: May return images with adult content. If the
            request is through the Image Search API, the response includes
            thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the
            request is through the Web Search API, the response includes
            thumbnail images that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the
            request is through the Image Search API, the response doesn't
            include images with adult content. If the request is through the
            Web Search API, the response may include images with adult content
            (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do not return
            images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the request
            comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that
            safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and
            uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the
            chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of
            what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if
            you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports
            the possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off',
            'Moderate', 'Strict'
            </param>
            <param name='size'>
            Filter images by the following sizes. All: Do not filter by size.
            Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the size
            parameter. Small: Return images that are less than 200x200 pixels.
            Medium: Return images that are greater than or equal to 200x200
            pixels but less than 500x500 pixels. Large: Return images that are
            500x500 pixels or larger. Wallpaper: Return wallpaper images. You
            may use this parameter along with the height or width parameters.
            For example, you may use height and size to request small images
            that are 150 pixels tall. Possible values include: 'All', 'Small',
            'Medium', 'Large', 'Wallpaper'
            </param>
            <param name='setLang'>
            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the
            language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example,
            the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English).
            Although optional, you should always specify the language.
            Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt
            unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a
            different language. This parameter and the

            interface string is a string that's used as a label in a user
            interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
            response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com properties in the
            response objects apply the specified language.
            </param>
            <param name='width'>
            Filter images that have the specified width, in pixels. You may use
            this filter with the size filter to return small images that have a
            width of 150 pixels.

            The Image Detail Search API lets you search on Bing and get back
            insights about an image, such as webpages that include the image.
            This section provides technical details about the query parameters
            and headers that you use to request insights of images and the JSON
            response objects that contain them. For examples that show how to
            make requests, see [Searching the Web for
            Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/search-the-web).

            example, to limit images to a specific domain, use the
            [site:](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) operator.
            To help improve relevance of an insights query (see

            query parameter. To determine the market to return results for,
            Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the list and
            combines it with the cc parameter value. If the list does not
            include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and
            market that supports the request or it uses an aggregated or
            default market for the results. To determine the market that Bing
            used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and the cc
            query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise,
            use the

            of an image in the body of a POST request. If you specify the image
            in the body of a POST request, you must specify this header and set
            its value to multipart/form-data. The maximum image size is 1 MB.
            </param>
            <param name='userAgent'>
            The user agent originating the request. Bing uses the user agent to
            provide mobile users with an optimized experience. Although
            optional, you are encouraged to always specify this header. The
            user-agent should be the same string that any commonly used browser
            sends. For information about user agents, see [RFC
            2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The

            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior
            across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features and
            improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
            traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID
            for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user
            to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple
            conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight
            assignment than the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also,
            Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that client
            ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user.
            Bing also uses this header to help improve result rankings by
            analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance
            improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing
            APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this
            header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests
            for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API
            consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
            click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing
            APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have
            a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not include this
            header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should
            NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user
            uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API
            request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist
            the client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent
            HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not
            use a session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the
            device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the
            user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If
            the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it
            for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If
            you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in
            the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is
            used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the location
            information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional,
            you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
            X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for
            example, by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address
            results in the location not being anywhere near the device's actual
            location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the
            client's geographical location. Bing uses the location information
            to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local
            content. Specify the key/value pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;.
            The following are the keys that you use to specify the user's
            location. lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in
            degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and
            less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long
            (required): The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
            longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or
            equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
            positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
            radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the
            coordinates. Pass the value returned by the device's location
            service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell
            tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
            location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since
            January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or
            direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees
            from 0 through 360, counting clockwise relative to true north.
            Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The
            horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client
            device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that
            specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this
            key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
            optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate
            the location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the
            location is especially important if the client's IP address does
            not accurately reflect the user's physical location (for example,
            if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include
            this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you
            should include this header.

            languages list, and combine that language with the country code
            that you specify to determine the market to return results for. If
            the languages list does not include a supported language, Bing
            finds the closest language and market that supports the request, or
            it may use an aggregated or default market for the results instead
            of a specified one. You should use this query parameter and the
            Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify multiple
            languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query
            parameters. This parameter and the

            A comma-delimited list of insights to request. The following are
            the possible case-insensitive values. All: Return all insights, if
            available, except RecognizedEntities. BRQ: Best representative
            query. The query term that best describes the image. Caption: A
            caption that provides information about the image. If the caption
            contains entities, the response may include links to images of
            those entities. Collections: A list of related images. Recipes: A
            list of recipes for cooking the food shown in the images.
            PagesIncluding: A list of webpages that include the image.
            RecognizedEntities: A list of entities (people) that were
            recognized in the image. NOTE: You may not specify this module with
            any other module. If you specify it with other modules, the
            response doesn't include recognized entities. RelatedSearches: A
            list of related searches made by others. ShoppingSources: A list of
            merchants where you can buy related offerings. SimilarImages: A
            list of images that are visually similar to the original image.
            SimilarProducts: A list of images that contain a product that is
            similar to a product found in the original image. Tags: Provides
            characteristics of the type of content found in the image. For
            example, if the image is of a person, the tags might indicate the
            person's gender and type of clothes they're wearing. If you specify
            a module and there is no data for the module, the response object
            doesn't include the related field. For example, if you specify
            Caption and it does not exist, the response doesn't include the
            imageCaption field. To include related searches, the request must
            include the original query string. Although the original query
            string is not required for similar images or products, you should
            always include it because it can help improve relevance and the
            results. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not
            specify this parameter when calling the Images, Trending Images, or
            Web Search APIs.
            </param>
            <param name='market'>
            The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the
            country where the user is making the request from. However, it
            could be a different country if the user is not located in a
            country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
            &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country code&gt;. For example, en-US. The
            string is case insensitive. For a list of possible market values,
            see [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
            NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market.
            Specifying the market helps Bing route the request and return an
            appropriate and optimal response. If you specify a market that is
            not listed in [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),

            <param name='safeSearch'>
            Filter images for adult content. The following are the possible
            filter values. Off: May return images with adult content. If the
            request is through the Image Search API, the response includes
            thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the
            request is through the Web Search API, the response includes
            thumbnail images that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the
            request is through the Image Search API, the response doesn't
            include images with adult content. If the request is through the
            Web Search API, the response may include images with adult content
            (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do not return
            images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the request
            comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that
            safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and
            uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the
            chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of
            what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if
            you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports
            the possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off',
            'Moderate', 'Strict'

            the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English).
            Although optional, you should always specify the language.
            Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt
            unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a
            different language. This parameter and the

            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior
            across Bing API calls. Bing often flights new features and
            improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning
            traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID
            for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user
            to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple
            conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight
            assignment than the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also,
            Bing can use the client ID to tailor web results to that client
            ID’s search history, providing a richer experience for the user.
            Bing also uses this header to help improve result rankings by
            analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The relevance
            improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing
            APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this
            header required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests
            for the same end user and device combination enables 1) the API
            consumer to receive a consistent user experience, and 2) higher
            click-through rates via better quality of results from the Bing
            APIs. Each user that uses your application on the device must have
            a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not include this
            header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should
            NOT include this header in a request is the first time the user
            uses your app on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API
            request that your app makes for this user on the device. Persist
            the client ID. To persist the ID in a browser app, use a persistent
            HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used across all sessions. Do not
            use a session cookie. For other apps such as mobile apps, use the
            device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The next time the
            user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If
            the response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it
            for all subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If
            you include the X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in
            the request.

            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is
            used to discover the user's location. Bing uses the location
            information to determine safe search behavior. Although optional,
            you are encouraged to always specify this header and the
            X-Search-Location header. Do not obfuscate the address (for
            example, by changing the last octet to 0). Obfuscating the address
            results in the location not being anywhere near the device's actual
            location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the
            client's geographical location. Bing uses the location information
            to determine safe search behavior and to return relevant local
            content. Specify the key/value pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;.
            The following are the keys that you use to specify the user's
            location. lat (required): The latitude of the client's location, in
            degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and
            less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long
            (required): The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The
            longitude must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or
            equal to +180.0. Negative values indicate western longitudes and
            positive values indicate eastern longitudes. re (required): The
            radius, in meters, which specifies the horizontal accuracy of the
            coordinates. Pass the value returned by the device's location
            service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m for cell
            tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the
            location. (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since
            January 1, 1970.) head (optional): The client's relative heading or
            direction of travel. Specify the direction of travel as degrees
            from 0 through 360, counting clockwise relative to true north.
            Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp (optional): The
            horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the client
            device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that
            specifies the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this
            key only if you specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are
            optional, the more information that you provide, the more accurate
            the location results are. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify the user's geographical location. Providing the
            location is especially important if the client's IP address does
            not accurately reflect the user's physical location (for example,
            if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you should include
            this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a minimum, you
            should include this header.
            </param>
            <param name='countryCode'>
            A 2-character country code of the country where the results come
            from. This API supports only the United States, Canada, Australia,
            and China markets. If you specify this query parameter, it must be
            set to us, ca, au, or cn. If you set this parameter, you must also
            specify the Accept-Language header. Bing uses the first supported
            language it finds from the languages list, and combine that
            language with the country code that you specify to determine the
            market to return results for. If the languages list does not
            include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and
            market that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or
            default market for the results instead of a specified one. You
            should use this query parameter and the Accept-Language query
            parameter only if you specify multiple languages; otherwise, you
            should use the mkt and setLang query parameters. This parameter and
            the mkt query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
            </param>
            <param name='market'>
            The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the
            country where the user is making the request from. However, it
            could be a different country if the user is not located in a
            country where Bing delivers results. The market must be in the form
            &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country code&gt;. For example, en-US. The
            string is case insensitive. For a list of possible market values,
            see [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
            NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market.
            Specifying the market helps Bing route the request and return an
            appropriate and optimal response. If you specify a market that is
            not listed in [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
            Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that
            is subject to change. This parameter and the

            query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
            </param>
            <param name='safeSearch'>
            Filter images for adult content. The following are the possible
            filter values. Off: May return images with adult content. If the
            request is through the Image Search API, the response includes
            thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the
            request is through the Web Search API, the response includes
            thumbnail images that are pixelated (fuzzy). Moderate: If the
            request is through the Image Search API, the response doesn't
            include images with adult content. If the request is through the
            Web Search API, the response may include images with adult content
            (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do not return
            images with adult content. The default is Moderate. If the request
            comes from a market that Bing's adult policy requires that
            safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing ignores the safeSearch value and
            uses Strict. If you use the site: query operator, there is the
            chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of
            what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only if
            you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports
            the possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off',
            'Moderate', 'Strict'
            </param>
            <param name='setLang'>
            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the
            language using the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example,
            the language code for English is EN. The default is EN (English).
            Although optional, you should always specify the language.
            Typically, you set setLang to the same language specified by mkt
            unless the user wants the user interface strings displayed in a
            different language. This parameter and the
            [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
            header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user
            interface string is a string that's used as a label in a user
            interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON

            query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set
            this header, you must also specify the
            [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
            query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
            the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with
            the cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language,
            Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it
            uses an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the
            market that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and
            the cc query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise,
            use the
            [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
            and

            query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a
            label in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
            response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
            apply the specified language.
            </param>
            <param name='userAgent'>
            The user agent originating the request. Bing uses the user agent to provide
            mobile users with an optimized experience. Although optional, you are
            encouraged to always specify this header. The user-agent should be the same
            string that any commonly used browser sends. For information about user
            agents, see [RFC
            2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The

            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing
            API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses
            the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you
            do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then
            Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to
            multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than
            the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client
            ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a
            richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help improve
            result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The
            relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by
            Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header
            required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
            end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better
            quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application
            on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not
            include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in
            the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT
            include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
            on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
            makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
            in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
            mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
            next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
            response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
            subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to
            discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to
            determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not
            obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
            Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
            device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous
            results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
            geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe
            search behavior and to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value
            pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;. The following are the keys that you use
            to specify the user's location. lat (required): The latitude of the
            client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal
            to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required):
            The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be
            greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
            values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
            longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the
            horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the
            device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m
            for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
            (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
            (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify
            the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
            relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
            (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
            client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies
            the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you
            specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more
            information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
            Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's
            geographical location. Providing the location is especially important if
            the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
            location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you
            should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a
            minimum, you should include this header.
            </param>
            <param name='aspect'>
            Filter images by the following aspect ratios. All: Do not filter by
            aspect.Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the aspect
            parameter. Square: Return images with standard aspect ratio. Wide: Return
            images with wide screen aspect ratio. Tall: Return images with tall aspect
            ratio. Possible values include: 'All', 'Square', 'Wide', 'Tall'
            </param>
            <param name='color'>
            Filter images by the following color options. ColorOnly: Return color
            images. Monochrome: Return black and white images. Return images with one
            of the following dominant colors: Black, Blue, Brown, Gray, Green, Orange,
            Pink, Purple, Red, Teal, White, Yellow. Possible values include:
            'ColorOnly', 'Monochrome', 'Black', 'Blue', 'Brown', 'Gray', 'Green',
            'Orange', 'Pink', 'Purple', 'Red', 'Teal', 'White', 'Yellow'
            </param>
            <param name='countryCode'>
            A 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. For
            a list of possible values, see [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
            If you set this parameter, you must also specify the
            [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
            header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages
            list, and combine that language with the country code that you specify to
            determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not
            include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market
            that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market
            for the results instead of a specified one. You should use this query
            parameter and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify
            multiple languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query
            parameters. This parameter and the
            [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)

            </param>
            <param name='count'>
            The number of images to return in the response. The actual number delivered
            may be less than requested. The default is 35. The maximum value is 150.
            You use this parameter along with the offset parameter to page results.For
            example, if your user interface displays 20 images per page, set count to
            20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results.For each subsequent
            page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). Use this parameter
            only with the Image Search API.Do not specify this parameter when calling
            the Insights, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
            </param>
            <param name='freshness'>
            Filter images by the following discovery options. Day: Return images
            discovered by Bing within the last 24 hours. Week: Return images discovered
            by Bing within the last 7 days. Month: Return images discovered by Bing
            within the last 30 days. Possible values include: 'Day', 'Week', 'Month'
            </param>
            <param name='height'>
            Filter images that have the specified height, in pixels. You may use this
            filter with the size filter to return small images that have a height of
            150 pixels.
            </param>
            <param name='id'>
            An ID that uniquely identifies an image. Use this parameter to ensure that
            the specified image is the first image in the list of images that Bing
            returns. The
            [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
            object's imageId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to.
            </param>
            <param name='imageContent'>
            Filter images by the following content types. Face: Return images that show
            only a person's face. Portrait: Return images that show only a person's

            <param name='license'>
            Filter images by the following license types. All: Do not filter by license
            type.Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the license
            parameter. Any: Return images that are under any license type. The response
            doesn't include images that do not specify a license or the license is
            unknown. Public: Return images where the creator has waived their exclusive
            rights, to the fullest extent allowed by law. Share: Return images that may
            be shared with others. Changing or editing the image might not be allowed.
            Also, modifying, sharing, and using the image for commercial purposes might
            not be allowed. Typically, this option returns the most images.
            ShareCommercially: Return images that may be shared with others for
            personal or commercial purposes. Changing or editing the image might not be
            allowed. Modify: Return images that may be modified, shared, and used.

            <param name='market'>
            The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the country where
            the user is making the request from. However, it could be a different
            country if the user is not located in a country where Bing delivers
            results. The market must be in the form &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country
            code&gt;. For example, en-US. The string is case insensitive. For a list of
            possible market values, see [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
            NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
            the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
            optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),

            maximum file size that you may specify is 520,192 bytes. If you specify a
            larger value, the API uses 520,192. It is possible that the response may
            include images that are slightly larger than the specified maximum. You may
            specify this filter and minFileSize to filter images within a range of file

            - count). Use this parameter along with the count parameter to page
            results. For example, if your user interface displays 20 images per page,
            set count to 20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For each
            subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). It is
            possible for multiple pages to include some overlap in results. To prevent
            duplicates, see

            thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do not return images with
            adult content. The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market
            that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing
            ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query
            operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult content
            regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only
            if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the
            possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate',
            'Strict'
            </param>
            <param name='size'>
            Filter images by the following sizes. All: Do not filter by size.
            Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the size parameter.
            Small: Return images that are less than 200x200 pixels. Medium: Return
            images that are greater than or equal to 200x200 pixels but less than
            500x500 pixels. Large: Return images that are 500x500 pixels or larger.
            Wallpaper: Return wallpaper images. You may use this parameter along with
            the height or width parameters. For example, you may use height and size to
            request small images that are 150 pixels tall. Possible values include:
            'All', 'Small', 'Medium', 'Large', 'Wallpaper'
            </param>
            <param name='setLang'>
            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using
            the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example, the language code for
            English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although optional, you should
            always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same
            language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings
            displayed in a different language. This parameter and the
            [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)

            is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
            interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
            properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
            </param>
            <param name='width'>
            Filter images that have the specified width, in pixels. You may use this
            filter with the size filter to return small images that have a width of 150
            pixels.

            The Image Detail Search API lets you search on Bing and get back insights
            about an image, such as webpages that include the image. This section
            provides technical details about the query parameters and headers that you
            use to request insights of images and the JSON response objects that
            contain them. For examples that show how to make requests, see [Searching
            the Web for
            Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/search-the-web).
            </summary>
            <param name='query'>
            The user's search query term. The term cannot be empty. The term may
            contain [Bing Advanced
            Operators](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795620.aspx). For example,
            to limit images to a specific domain, use the
            [site:](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff795613.aspx) operator. To help
            improve relevance of an insights query (see

            you should always include the user's query term. Use this parameter only
            with the Image Search API.Do not specify this parameter when calling the
            Trending Images API.
            </param>
            <param name='acceptLanguage'>
            A comma-delimited list of one or more languages to use for user interface
            strings. The list is in decreasing order of preference. For additional
            information, including expected format, see
            [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
            header and the

            query parameter are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. If you set
            this header, you must also specify the
            [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
            query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
            the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with
            the cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language,
            Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it
            uses an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the
            market that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and
            the cc query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise,
            use the
            [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
            and

            query parameters. A user interface string is a string that's used as a
            label in a user interface. There are few user interface strings in the JSON
            response objects. Any links to Bing.com properties in the response objects
            apply the specified language.
            </param>
            <param name='contentType'>
            Optional request header. If you set the

            query parameter to RecognizedEntities, you may specify the binary of an
            image in the body of a POST request. If you specify the image in the body
            of a POST request, you must specify this header and set its value to
            multipart/form-data. The maximum image size is 1 MB.
            </param>
            <param name='userAgent'>
            The user agent originating the request. Bing uses the user agent to provide
            mobile users with an optimized experience. Although optional, you are
            encouraged to always specify this header. The user-agent should be the same
            string that any commonly used browser sends. For information about user
            agents, see [RFC
            2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). The

            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing
            API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses
            the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you
            do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then
            Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to
            multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than
            the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client
            ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a
            richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help improve
            result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The
            relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by
            Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header
            required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
            end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better
            quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application
            on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not
            include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in
            the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT
            include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
            on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
            makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
            in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
            mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
            next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
            response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
            subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to
            discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to
            determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not
            obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
            Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
            device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous
            results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
            geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe
            search behavior and to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value
            pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;. The following are the keys that you use
            to specify the user's location. lat (required): The latitude of the
            client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal
            to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required):
            The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be
            greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
            values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
            longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the
            horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the
            device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m
            for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
            (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
            (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify
            the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
            relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
            (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
            client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies
            the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you
            specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more
            information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
            Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's
            geographical location. Providing the location is especially important if
            the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
            location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you
            should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a
            minimum, you should include this header.

            If you set this parameter, you must also specify the
            [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
            header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages
            list, and combine that language with the country code that you specify to
            determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not
            include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market
            that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market
            for the results instead of a specified one. You should use this query
            parameter and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify
            multiple languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query
            parameters. This parameter and the

            specify this parameter when calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web
            Search APIs.
            </param>
            <param name='modules'>
            A comma-delimited list of insights to request. The following are the
            possible case-insensitive values. All: Return all insights, if available,
            except RecognizedEntities. BRQ: Best representative query. The query term
            that best describes the image. Caption: A caption that provides information
            about the image. If the caption contains entities, the response may include
            links to images of those entities. Collections: A list of related images.
            Recipes: A list of recipes for cooking the food shown in the images.
            PagesIncluding: A list of webpages that include the image.
            RecognizedEntities: A list of entities (people) that were recognized in the
            image. NOTE: You may not specify this module with any other module. If you
            specify it with other modules, the response doesn't include recognized
            entities. RelatedSearches: A list of related searches made by others.
            ShoppingSources: A list of merchants where you can buy related offerings.
            SimilarImages: A list of images that are visually similar to the original
            image. SimilarProducts: A list of images that contain a product that is
            similar to a product found in the original image. Tags: Provides
            characteristics of the type of content found in the image. For example, if
            the image is of a person, the tags might indicate the person's gender and
            type of clothes they're wearing. If you specify a module and there is no
            data for the module, the response object doesn't include the related field.
            For example, if you specify Caption and it does not exist, the response
            doesn't include the imageCaption field. To include related searches, the
            request must include the original query string. Although the original query
            string is not required for similar images or products, you should always
            include it because it can help improve relevance and the results. Use this
            parameter only with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when
            calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.

            The Image Trending Search API lets you search on Bing and get back a list
            of images that are trending based on search requests made by others. The
            images are broken out into different categories. For example, Popular

            the cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language,
            Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it
            uses an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the
            market that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and

            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing
            API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses
            the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you
            do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then
            Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to
            multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than
            the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client
            ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a
            richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help improve
            result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The
            relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by
            Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header
            required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
            end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better
            quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application
            on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not
            include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in
            the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT
            include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
            on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
            makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
            in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
            mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
            next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
            response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
            subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to
            discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to
            determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not
            obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
            Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
            device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous
            results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
            geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe
            search behavior and to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value
            pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;. The following are the keys that you use
            to specify the user's location. lat (required): The latitude of the
            client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal
            to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required):
            The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be
            greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
            values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
            longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the
            horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the
            device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m
            for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
            (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
            (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify
            the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
            relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
            (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
            client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies
            the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you
            specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more
            information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
            Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's
            geographical location. Providing the location is especially important if
            the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
            location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you
            should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a
            minimum, you should include this header.
            </param>
            <param name='countryCode'>
            A 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. This
            API supports only the United States, Canada, Australia, and China markets.
            If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us, ca, au, or cn.
            If you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language
            header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages
            list, and combine that language with the country code that you specify to
            determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not
            include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market
            that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market
            for the results instead of a specified one. You should use this query
            parameter and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify
            multiple languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query
            parameters. This parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually

            The Image Search API lets you send a search query to Bing and get back a
            list of relevant images. This section provides technical details about the
            query parameters and headers that you use to request images and the JSON
            response objects that contain them. For examples that show how to make
            requests, see [Searching the Web for
            Images](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/bing-image-search/search-the-web).

            <param name='acceptLanguage'>
            A comma-delimited list of one or more languages to use for user interface
            strings. The list is in decreasing order of preference. For additional
            information, including expected format, see
            [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
            header and the

            query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
            the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with
            the cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language,
            Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it
            uses an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the
            market that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and
            the cc query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise,
            use the
            [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)

            encouraged to always specify this header. The user-agent should be the same
            string that any commonly used browser sends. For information about user

            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing
            API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses
            the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you
            do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then
            Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to
            multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than
            the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client
            ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a
            richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help improve
            result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The
            relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by
            Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header
            required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
            end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better
            quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application
            on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not
            include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in
            the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT
            include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
            on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
            makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
            in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
            mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
            next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
            response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
            subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to
            discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to
            determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not
            obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
            Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
            device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous
            results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
            geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe
            search behavior and to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value
            pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;. The following are the keys that you use
            to specify the user's location. lat (required): The latitude of the
            client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal
            to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required):
            The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be
            greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
            values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
            longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the
            horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the
            device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m
            for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
            (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
            (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify
            the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
            relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
            (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
            client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies
            the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you
            specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more
            information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
            Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's
            geographical location. Providing the location is especially important if
            the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
            location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you
            should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a
            minimum, you should include this header.

            <param name='aspect'>
            Filter images by the following aspect ratios. All: Do not filter by

            header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages
            list, and combine that language with the country code that you specify to
            determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not
            include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market
            that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market
            for the results instead of a specified one. You should use this query
            parameter and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify
            multiple languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query
            parameters. This parameter and the

            <param name='count'>
            The number of images to return in the response. The actual number delivered
            may be less than requested. The default is 35. The maximum value is 150.
            You use this parameter along with the offset parameter to page results.For
            example, if your user interface displays 20 images per page, set count to
            20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results.For each subsequent
            page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). Use this parameter
            only with the Image Search API.Do not specify this parameter when calling
            the Insights, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.

            <param name='market'>
            The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the country where
            the user is making the request from. However, it could be a different
            country if the user is not located in a country where Bing delivers
            results. The market must be in the form &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country
            code&gt;. For example, en-US. The string is case insensitive. For a list of
            possible market values, see [Market

            larger value, the API uses 520,192. It is possible that the response may
            include images that are slightly larger than the specified maximum. You may
            specify this filter and minFileSize to filter images within a range of file
            sizes.
            </param>
            <param name='maxHeight'>
            Filter images that have a height that is less than or equal to the
            specified height. Specify the height in pixels. You may specify this filter
            and minHeight to filter images within a range of heights. This filter and
            the height filter are mutually exclusive.
            </param>
            <param name='maxWidth'>
            Filter images that have a width that is less than or equal to the specified
            width. Specify the width in pixels. You may specify this filter and
            maxWidth to filter images within a range of widths. This filter and the
            width filter are mutually exclusive.
            </param>
            <param name='minFileSize'>
            Filter images that are greater than or equal to the specified file size.
            The maximum file size that you may specify is 520,192 bytes. If you specify
            a larger value, the API uses 520,192. It is possible that the response may
            include images that are slightly smaller than the specified minimum. You
            may specify this filter and maxFileSize to filter images within a range of
            file sizes.
            </param>
            <param name='minHeight'>
            Filter images that have a height that is greater than or equal to the
            specified height. Specify the height in pixels. You may specify this filter
            and maxHeight to filter images within a range of heights. This filter and
            the height filter are mutually exclusive.
            </param>
            <param name='minWidth'>
            Filter images that have a width that is greater than or equal to the
            specified width. Specify the width in pixels. You may specify this filter
            and maxWidth to filter images within a range of widths. This filter and the
            width filter are mutually exclusive.
            </param>
            <param name='offset'>
            The zero-based offset that indicates the number of images to skip before
            returning images. The default is 0. The offset should be less than
            ([totalEstimatedMatches](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#totalestimatedmatches)
            - count). Use this parameter along with the count parameter to page
            results. For example, if your user interface displays 20 images per page,
            set count to 20 and offset to 0 to get the first page of results. For each
            subsequent page, increment offset by 20 (for example, 0, 20, 40). It is
            possible for multiple pages to include some overlap in results. To prevent
            duplicates, see
            [nextOffset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#nextoffset).
            Use this parameter only with the Image API. Do not specify this parameter
            when calling the Trending Images API or the Web Search API.
            </param>
            <param name='safeSearch'>
            Filter images for adult content. The following are the possible filter
            values. Off: May return images with adult content. If the request is
            through the Image Search API, the response includes thumbnail images that
            are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the request is through the Web Search
            API, the response includes thumbnail images that are pixelated (fuzzy).
            Moderate: If the request is through the Image Search API, the response
            doesn't include images with adult content. If the request is through the
            Web Search API, the response may include images with adult content (the
            thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do not return images with
            adult content. The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market
            that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing
            ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query
            operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult content
            regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only
            if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the
            possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate',
            'Strict'
            </param>
            <param name='size'>
            Filter images by the following sizes. All: Do not filter by size.
            Specifying this value is the same as not specifying the size parameter.
            Small: Return images that are less than 200x200 pixels. Medium: Return
            images that are greater than or equal to 200x200 pixels but less than
            500x500 pixels. Large: Return images that are 500x500 pixels or larger.
            Wallpaper: Return wallpaper images. You may use this parameter along with
            the height or width parameters. For example, you may use height and size to
            request small images that are 150 pixels tall. Possible values include:
            'All', 'Small', 'Medium', 'Large', 'Wallpaper'

            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using
            the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example, the language code for
            English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although optional, you should
            always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same
            language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings
            displayed in a different language. This parameter and the

            </param>
            <param name='acceptLanguage'>
            A comma-delimited list of one or more languages to use for user interface
            strings. The list is in decreasing order of preference. For additional
            information, including expected format, see
            [RFC2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html). This
            header and the

            [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
            query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
            the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with
            the cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language,
            Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it
            uses an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the
            market that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and
            the cc query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise,
            use the

            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing
            API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses
            the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you
            do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then
            Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to
            multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than
            the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client
            ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a
            richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help improve
            result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The
            relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by
            Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header
            required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
            end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better
            quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application
            on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not
            include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in
            the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT
            include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
            on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
            makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
            in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
            mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
            next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
            response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
            subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to
            discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to
            determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not
            obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
            Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
            device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous
            results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
            geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe
            search behavior and to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value
            pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;. The following are the keys that you use
            to specify the user's location. lat (required): The latitude of the
            client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal
            to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required):
            The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be
            greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
            values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
            longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the
            horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the
            device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m
            for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
            (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
            (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify
            the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
            relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
            (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
            client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies
            the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you
            specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more
            information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
            Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's
            geographical location. Providing the location is especially important if
            the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
            location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you
            should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a
            minimum, you should include this header.

            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
            If you set this parameter, you must also specify the
            [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
            header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages
            list, and combine that language with the country code that you specify to
            determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not
            include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market
            that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market
            for the results instead of a specified one. You should use this query
            parameter and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify
            multiple languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query
            parameters. This parameter and the
            [mkt](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#mkt)
            query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
            </param>
            <param name='id'>
            An ID that uniquely identifies an image. Use this parameter to ensure that
            the specified image is the first image in the list of images that Bing
            returns. The
            [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
            object's imageId field contains the ID that you set this parameter to.
            </param>
            <param name='imageUrl'>
            The URL of an image that you want to get insights of. Use this parameter as
            an alternative to using the insightsToken parameter to specify the image.
            You may also specify the image by placing the binary of the image in the
            body of a POST request. If you use the binary option, see the
            [Content-Type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#contenttype)
            header. The maximum supported image size is 1 MB. Use this parameter only
            with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when calling the
            Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
            </param>
            <param name='insightsToken'>
            An image token. The
            [Image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image)
            object's
            [imageInsightsToken](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#image-imageinsightstoken)
            contains the token. Specify this parameter to get additional information
            about an image, such as a caption or shopping source. For a list of the
            additional information about an image that you can get, see the
            [modules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#modulesrequested)
            query parameter. Use this parameter only with the Insights API. Do not
            specify this parameter when calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web
            Search APIs.
            </param>
            <param name='modules'>
            A comma-delimited list of insights to request. The following are the
            possible case-insensitive values. All: Return all insights, if available,
            except RecognizedEntities. BRQ: Best representative query. The query term
            that best describes the image. Caption: A caption that provides information
            about the image. If the caption contains entities, the response may include
            links to images of those entities. Collections: A list of related images.
            Recipes: A list of recipes for cooking the food shown in the images.
            PagesIncluding: A list of webpages that include the image.
            RecognizedEntities: A list of entities (people) that were recognized in the
            image. NOTE: You may not specify this module with any other module. If you
            specify it with other modules, the response doesn't include recognized
            entities. RelatedSearches: A list of related searches made by others.
            ShoppingSources: A list of merchants where you can buy related offerings.
            SimilarImages: A list of images that are visually similar to the original
            image. SimilarProducts: A list of images that contain a product that is
            similar to a product found in the original image. Tags: Provides
            characteristics of the type of content found in the image. For example, if
            the image is of a person, the tags might indicate the person's gender and
            type of clothes they're wearing. If you specify a module and there is no
            data for the module, the response object doesn't include the related field.
            For example, if you specify Caption and it does not exist, the response
            doesn't include the imageCaption field. To include related searches, the
            request must include the original query string. Although the original query
            string is not required for similar images or products, you should always
            include it because it can help improve relevance and the results. Use this
            parameter only with the Insights API. Do not specify this parameter when
            calling the Images, Trending Images, or Web Search APIs.
            </param>
            <param name='market'>
            The market where the results come from. Typically, mkt is the country where
            the user is making the request from. However, it could be a different
            country if the user is not located in a country where Bing delivers
            results. The market must be in the form &lt;language code&gt;-&lt;country
            code&gt;. For example, en-US. The string is case insensitive. For a list of
            possible market values, see [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes).
            NOTE: If known, you are encouraged to always specify the market. Specifying
            the market helps Bing route the request and return an appropriate and
            optimal response. If you specify a market that is not listed in [Market
            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
            Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
            subject to change. This parameter and the

            <param name='safeSearch'>
            Filter images for adult content. The following are the possible filter
            values. Off: May return images with adult content. If the request is
            through the Image Search API, the response includes thumbnail images that
            are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the request is through the Web Search
            API, the response includes thumbnail images that are pixelated (fuzzy).
            Moderate: If the request is through the Image Search API, the response
            doesn't include images with adult content. If the request is through the
            Web Search API, the response may include images with adult content (the
            thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do not return images with
            adult content. The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market
            that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing
            ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query
            operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult content
            regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only
            if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the
            possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate',
            'Strict'

            <param name='setLang'>
            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using
            the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example, the language code for
            English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although optional, you should
            always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same
            language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings
            displayed in a different language. This parameter and the

            query parameter. To determine the market to return results for, Bing uses
            the first supported language it finds from the list and combines it with
            the cc parameter value. If the list does not include a supported language,
            Bing finds the closest language and market that supports the request or it
            uses an aggregated or default market for the results. To determine the
            market that Bing used, see the BingAPIs-Market header. Use this header and
            the cc query parameter only if you specify multiple languages. Otherwise,
            use the

            encouraged to always specify this header. The user-agent should be the same
            string that any commonly used browser sends. For information about user
            agents, see [RFC

            </param>
            <param name='clientId'>
            Bing uses this header to provide users with consistent behavior across Bing
            API calls. Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses
            the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you
            do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then
            Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to
            multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.
            For example, if the second request has a different flight assignment than
            the first, the experience may be unexpected. Also, Bing can use the client
            ID to tailor web results to that client ID’s search history, providing a
            richer experience for the user. Bing also uses this header to help improve
            result rankings by analyzing the activity generated by a client ID. The
            relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by
            Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API
            consumer. IMPORTANT: Although optional, you should consider this header
            required. Persisting the client ID across multiple requests for the same
            end user and device combination enables 1) the API consumer to receive a
            consistent user experience, and 2) higher click-through rates via better
            quality of results from the Bing APIs. Each user that uses your application
            on the device must have a unique, Bing generated client ID. If you do not
            include this header in the request, Bing generates an ID and returns it in
            the X-MSEdge-ClientID response header. The only time that you should NOT
            include this header in a request is the first time the user uses your app
            on that device. Use the client ID for each Bing API request that your app
            makes for this user on the device. Persist the client ID. To persist the ID
            in a browser app, use a persistent HTTP cookie to ensure the ID is used
            across all sessions. Do not use a session cookie. For other apps such as
            mobile apps, use the device's persistent storage to persist the ID. The
            next time the user uses your app on that device, get the client ID that you
            persisted. Bing responses may or may not include this header. If the
            response includes this header, capture the client ID and use it for all
            subsequent Bing requests for the user on that device. If you include the
            X-MSEdge-ClientID, you must not include cookies in the request.
            </param>
            <param name='clientIp'>
            The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the client device. The IP address is used to
            discover the user's location. Bing uses the location information to
            determine safe search behavior. Although optional, you are encouraged to
            always specify this header and the X-Search-Location header. Do not
            obfuscate the address (for example, by changing the last octet to 0).
            Obfuscating the address results in the location not being anywhere near the
            device's actual location, which may result in Bing serving erroneous
            results.
            </param>
            <param name='location'>
            A semicolon-delimited list of key/value pairs that describe the client's
            geographical location. Bing uses the location information to determine safe
            search behavior and to return relevant local content. Specify the key/value
            pair as &lt;key&gt;:&lt;value&gt;. The following are the keys that you use
            to specify the user's location. lat (required): The latitude of the
            client's location, in degrees. The latitude must be greater than or equal
            to -90.0 and less than or equal to +90.0. Negative values indicate southern
            latitudes and positive values indicate northern latitudes. long (required):
            The longitude of the client's location, in degrees. The longitude must be
            greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to +180.0. Negative
            values indicate western longitudes and positive values indicate eastern
            longitudes. re (required): The radius, in meters, which specifies the
            horizontal accuracy of the coordinates. Pass the value returned by the
            device's location service. Typical values might be 22m for GPS/Wi-Fi, 380m
            for cell tower triangulation, and 18,000m for reverse IP lookup. ts
            (optional): The UTC UNIX timestamp of when the client was at the location.
            (The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970.) head
            (optional): The client's relative heading or direction of travel. Specify
            the direction of travel as degrees from 0 through 360, counting clockwise
            relative to true north. Specify this key only if the sp key is nonzero. sp
            (optional): The horizontal velocity (speed), in meters per second, that the
            client device is traveling. alt (optional): The altitude of the client
            device, in meters. are (optional): The radius, in meters, that specifies
            the vertical accuracy of the coordinates. Specify this key only if you
            specify the alt key. Although many of the keys are optional, the more
            information that you provide, the more accurate the location results are.
            Although optional, you are encouraged to always specify the user's
            geographical location. Providing the location is especially important if
            the client's IP address does not accurately reflect the user's physical
            location (for example, if the client uses VPN). For optimal results, you
            should include this header and the X-MSEdge-ClientIP header, but at a
            minimum, you should include this header.
            </param>
            <param name='countryCode'>
            A 2-character country code of the country where the results come from. This
            API supports only the United States, Canada, Australia, and China markets.
            If you specify this query parameter, it must be set to us, ca, au, or cn.
            If you set this parameter, you must also specify the Accept-Language
            header. Bing uses the first supported language it finds from the languages
            list, and combine that language with the country code that you specify to
            determine the market to return results for. If the languages list does not
            include a supported language, Bing finds the closest language and market
            that supports the request, or it may use an aggregated or default market
            for the results instead of a specified one. You should use this query
            parameter and the Accept-Language query parameter only if you specify
            multiple languages; otherwise, you should use the mkt and setLang query
            parameters. This parameter and the mkt query parameter are mutually
            exclusive—do not specify both.

            Codes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#market-codes),
            Bing uses a best fit market code based on an internal mapping that is
            subject to change. This parameter and the
            [cc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#cc)
            query parameter are mutually exclusive—do not specify both.
            </param>
            <param name='safeSearch'>
            Filter images for adult content. The following are the possible filter
            values. Off: May return images with adult content. If the request is
            through the Image Search API, the response includes thumbnail images that
            are clear (non-fuzzy). However, if the request is through the Web Search
            API, the response includes thumbnail images that are pixelated (fuzzy).
            Moderate: If the request is through the Image Search API, the response
            doesn't include images with adult content. If the request is through the
            Web Search API, the response may include images with adult content (the
            thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). Strict: Do not return images with
            adult content. The default is Moderate. If the request comes from a market
            that Bing's adult policy requires that safeSearch is set to Strict, Bing
            ignores the safeSearch value and uses Strict. If you use the site: query
            operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult content
            regardless of what the safeSearch query parameter is set to. Use site: only
            if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the
            possibility of adult content. Possible values include: 'Off', 'Moderate',
            'Strict'
            </param>
            <param name='setLang'>
            The language to use for user interface strings. Specify the language using
            the ISO 639-1 2-letter language code. For example, the language code for
            English is EN. The default is EN (English). Although optional, you should
            always specify the language. Typically, you set setLang to the same
            language specified by mkt unless the user wants the user interface strings
            displayed in a different language. This parameter and the
            [Accept-Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cognitiveservices/bing-images-api-v7-reference#acceptlanguage)
            header are mutually exclusive; do not specify both. A user interface string
            is a string that's used as a label in a user interface. There are few user
            interface strings in the JSON response objects. Also, any links to Bing.com
            properties in the response objects apply the specified language.
